# software-developer-learning-pathways
To collate ideas, materials, resources, links, guides, howtos to help software engineers and developers to grow and progress

CDDO are working on a learning pathway for software engineers and developers. The pathway will be a place where any developer will be able to go to find out what learning opportunities exist for them that could help them progress in their role and develop new skills. 

We're now crowdsourcing ideas from the community to help build the pathway. We want to know about any resources you've found useful that have helped you become good at your job. 

These could be courses, guides, books, events, meetups, on-the-job learning opportunities, or just ideas for what a person could do to become a good software engineer or developer and keep growing.  

We also want to know about anything you haven't found useful and why. Or anything that you would like to learn but haven't been able to. 

We know that some work has been done in this area by some departments/communities and we want to hear about that too. 

Please share your ideas here - thank you!
